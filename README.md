# REST API with Kotlin

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin:** The project is developed using the Kotlin programming language, a concise and expressive language that interoperates seamlessly with Java.
  
- **Coroutines:** Leveraging Kotlin's coroutine support for asynchronous programming, making concurrent and parallel code execution more manageable.
  
- **Flow:** Utilizing Kotlin Flow to represent and process asynchronous sequences of values, providing a reactive programming approach.
  
- **r2dbc:** Using Reactive Relational Database Connectivity (R2DBC) to interact with databases in a reactive, non-blocking manner.
  
- **PostgreSQL:** The project relies on PostgreSQL as the database management system, providing a powerful and open-source relational database solution.

## Usage

You can find REST END-POINTS within: databora-restapi-reactive.postman_collection JSON file in the root.
Also you can run SQL query in pgAdmin from file: SQL for Postgresql so that you have schema ready for END-POINTS.
